# Conference-Talk-Planner
This School Java Application Project was built for managing Conference talks. It provides a JavaFX interface for helping users organize and set up conference speeches as
well as for helping users sign up for available conference speeches at a specific time. Users can either sign up as a speaker to a conference talk, or users can sign up 
as an attendee for a conference talk. Certain Users can also sign up as Organizers which function similar to IT Administrators. Organizers help create and set up 
conference talk times and can access user statistics for all Attendees and Speakers in the system. Finally, numerous additional features were added to change the 
CLI based project into a GUI based project.

## How to Play around with the Project
AppMain contains the static main method to run. Upon running AppMain, you have the option to sign up or login as an Organizer, Speaker, or Attendee. The Progam will also save
all changes via Serialization.

## Key Functions the Conference Talk Planner Performs (not exhaustive)

Organizers can create events, remove events, message other users, and view the user statistics of Speaker accounts, Attendee accounts, and their own account. 
Attendees can attend events, leave events, message other users, and view their own account statistics. Speakers can attend an event as a speaker, leave an event, 
message other users, and view their own account statistics. There is also an autofill function to help users find the user name of a user they want to
message or to help users find the event title of an event they want to attend.
